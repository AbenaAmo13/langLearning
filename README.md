![Empower Us Homepage](https://github.com/AbenaAmo13/langLearning/blob/main/empowerUsImage.png)


## Overview

In Ghana, many individuals face challenges in accessing government resources and information due to low literacy levels, limited network connectivity, and language barriers. 
Most websites, including the Ghanaian government site, offer little to no support for users with low literacy and limited network access. 
Additionally, the majority of these websites and procedures, such as registering for a Ghana Card, are in English, despite 80% of Ghanaians primarily speaking Twi.


## Purpose

This project aims to address these issues by developing a language learning progressive web application (PWA). The application is designed to:

1. Teach English to individuals with low literacy levels.
2. Function efficiently with limited network connectivity.
3. Present government information in an accessible format.

This project was created as a result of extensive research on creating application for individuals with low literacy. 


## Implementation

The application is an offline first progressive web application created using React, HTML, and CSS. 
It also uses IndexedDB as the client side storage since it is primarily made for limited network connectivity. 

## Installation

This project must first be cloned. After cloning, this project you need to run the following commands:

```
npm install 
```
The above allows you to install all the packages listed in the package.json. 

After this to run the program, you will need to type this command: 

```
npm run start 
```
That's it! To install the application and use it offline, click the "Install" button in the top app bar, as shown in the image above.
